# rt-in-one-weekend-rust

This is a rust implementation of the book series ["Ray Tracing in One Weekend"](https://raytracing.github.io/).

I made this mainly for learning Rust, since I believe that the best way to learn a language is to use it.

As for the reason of choosing to do a ray tracer...That's because, it is fun and romantic!

## Getting Started
Clone this repo, and run `cargo run --release`, wait for a while, then you will find the output `out.png` at the root folder.

## TODO

    - [ ] Basics (pure on CPU)
    - [ ] Optimize using multi-threading
    - [ ] Optimize using compute shaders (using [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu))
- [ ] Implement Book II (TBD)
- [ ] Implement Book III (TBD)
